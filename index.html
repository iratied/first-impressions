            When you walk through the streets there are groups of men sitting, talking, <b>smoking (narguileh), and drinking turkish coffee. </b> 
            Walking by a street 11am and at 6pm the same group of men will be seen sitting on the same corner.
            <br>
            <br>
            Boys are playing football, talking to each other, walking around. 
            <br>
            [everyone here watches La Liga so when I tell anyone that I am Spanish they always respond "real madrid or barça?"]
            <br>
            <br>
            Children pour out of the buildings; for every adult in Naba'a there seems to be at least 3 children. 
            <br>
            <br>
            No one lives in his own house-- it is hospitality in a sense that can't even be expressed in english. 
            <br>
            <br>
           <b>For men, life happens on the streets of Naba’a. For women, it is in each other’s homes. </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Here, there is no such thing as visiting a single person; 
            inevitably, going to someone's house means bumping into someone else there and then going to that person's home and then over to their neighbors and so on until, if you do not set clear boundaries, you have drunk and eaten yourself nearly into a coma.

            Yesterday, when he saw that I had not locked my front door, my math tutor reprimanded me saying “make sure you lock the door; this is a bad neighborhood, a very bad neighborhood.”
            And yet, from my experience I have no means to  justify such a statement

            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class="mb-5">Here, <b>there is electricity for about 8 hours per </b> day so most people have
            a motor that kicks in to fill the gap left by power outages. 
            <br>
            <br>
            These motors have switches generally located on the outside wall of the building where the owners of it live. 
            When there is too much consumption of electricity, the motors jump and the switch flips down. 
            <br>
            For the motor to start working again, the switch needs to be flipped back up, which can be a hassle 
            especially for people living on high floors who have to walk down many flights of stairs to turn on their 
            motors. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When walking past a switch box, children will stop and flip up the ones that are down— a very simple act 
            that takes only a couple of seconds but spares a lot of inconvenience. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            For me, the biggest shock stemming from the power outages wan’t so much their regularity but rather people’s 
            reactions to them. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I remember being in the middle of a conversation with Abir (who you will get to know soon,
            in my next post) and as she was speaking the room went pitch dark. 
            <br>
            She continued speaking without a pause, without even the slightest hesitation. 
            <br>
            About a minute later, the motor kicked in and the lights came back on, only to be met with the same indifference. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Power outages happen everywhere, everyday (even at the mall!) so Lebanese people are so used to them that they never react. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Humans breathe oxygen and sometimes the room will go dark as I speak, facts of life. </b>

            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class="mb-5">
            Life in Naba’a is very difficult; the neighborhood is a bit chaotic, severely under-serviced, and incredibly 
            overpopulated. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Areas around Bourj Hammoud were once predominantly Christian but the influx of Syrians has impacted the 
            demographic makeup. 
            <br>
            <b>Refugees are mainly (Sunni) Muslim </b>so many of the Lebanese Christians who once inhabited the area have 
            moved away; 
            however, not everyone can afford to do so since <b>the influx of Syrians has made the price of housing skyrocket.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The intertwined histories of Syria and Lebanon serve to worsen tensions here.
            <b>Syria occupied Lebanon from 1976 to 2005 and continued long after to exert its influence over the 
            Lebanese government through assassination of leaders not favorable to it. </b>
            <br>
            Despite their countries’ histories, here, Lebanese and Syrians have to coexist. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But, in my opinion, <b> just as oppression breeds nationalism (referendum for Catalonia!), 
            competition breeds sectarianism. </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Consequently, many Christians here are especially showy and theatrical about the fact that 
            they are Christian (in order to distinguish themselves from Muslims). 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is all linked to the complex role that religion plays in Lebanese society and politics (which is not an easy thing to explain). 
            <br>
            <b>The exact religious makeup of the country is not know because performing a census would be too dangerous 
            to the status quo (and the maintaining of peace). </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The most important political posts are divided between each of the three major religions: 
            the president has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker 
            of Parliament a Shi’a Muslim. 
            <br>
            (but religion is really a story for another post so stay tuned :)

            <p class="mb-5"> Armenians maintain much of their cultural identity; they have their own schools and churches in which they continue to speak Armenian. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Last week, my sociology teacher (who is of Armenian descent) told me about a very big divide amongst people 
            of Armenian heritage in Lebanon.
            
            His family has been in here for four generations so he doesn’t feel any more Armenian than he does Lebanese.
            <br>
            However, he says that <b> many Armenians see Lebanon as the place where they happen to live 
            but not one to which they hold any allegiance. </b> 
            To them, if conflict arises in Armenia it is their responsibility to take up arms but 
            not necessarily so if a similar thing happened in Lebanon. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I thought it a curious thing.
            <br>
            <b>At what point does one become Lebanese </b> (or in my case American)? 
            <br>
            My answer: hopefully never (which I guess is a common viewpoint)
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Also, Armenian last names end in -ian or -yan (eg. Kardashian) </b>
